# TODO

A simple very TODO application implemented with vue to test some of the aspects of vue

I had an idea to implement all the interactions with the store in a custom hook called [useTodoHook](./src/hooks/todoStore.js), afterwards use the methods and computed values in the components like in the [TodoList.vue](./src/components/TodoList.vue#L17) or in the [TheForm.vue](./src/components/TheForm.vue#L13)
